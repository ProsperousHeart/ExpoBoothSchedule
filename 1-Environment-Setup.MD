# Ensure Your Repo Is Local

Using whatever method you generally follow, ensure your repo is on your local machine.

# Prepare Your Environment

Ensure you have python installed. For this project, we are using 3.6.5 versiom.

It is always best practice to complete your projects in their own virtual environment. Therefore, we will follow [this doc](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/virtualenvs.md) - specifically:
- the [virtualenv](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/virtualenvs.md#virtualenv) section
  - the [virtualenvwrapper](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/virtualenvs.md#virtualenvwrapper) section, which will make things SO awesome (my favorite reason being that when you turn on the virtual machine, it takes you directly in to the folder your [project](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/virtualenvs.md#alternative) is stored in)
